This project will, hopefully, not only replace the current Louisville English Country Dance website, but...
  1. Will make the site more responsive on other devices
  2. Allow dancers to sign-in to see and share information with other dancers

  ... it would also be nice to have a separate format for the group founders when they sign-in so...

  3. They can add and edit content on the site
